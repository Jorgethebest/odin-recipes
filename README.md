what i learned so far in the odin project is many things. 
first of all i learned how to use Github.
I am not a pro but, i am getting better 
I learned that git status lets you know the status of the page and if you changed anything.
Git add with a period (git add .) to add something make sure to command s 
git status to make sure you saved and its green to make sure you changed something
once you put git add next is git commit (git commit -m "") to add a message in between the quotations.
after you have added your message on git commit, type in git push to send the message and type in password for computer.
something else i have learned is how to code mostly
Its sometimes understandable
<p></p> is for paragraphs 
<h1></h1>is for headings 
<!-is for message for yourself to see what you've changed
   to add pictures its img src...
   absolute link is something you have to search up online.
   relative link is yours something on your computer ../
   overall have learned many thing 
   i am not a pro yet
i will still try my hardest 
Thank you odin!!
Have learned very much from here.
